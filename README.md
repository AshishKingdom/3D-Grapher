![GitHub Logo](screenshot.png)

## Descripton:
*  Plots real-valued surfaces defined as z=f(x,y) in 3D.
*  User specifies f(x,y) i.e. sin((x^2)-(y^2)), via input dialog or file.
*  Height map generated by Sxript evaluator.
*  Graphics generated using OpenGL commands.

## Controls:
*  Left-click+drag mouse on screen to rotate view about z-axis.
*  Mousewheel adjusts zoom factor.
*  SPACE swaps between solid vs mesh rendering modes.
*  Right-click to enter new function f(x,y).
